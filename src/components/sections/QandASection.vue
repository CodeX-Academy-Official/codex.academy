            Traditional educational models utilize a centuries-old mechanism to
            keep classes of students together and help maximize the value of
            teachers and instructors:

          </p>
          <p>
            That's right... "time". In a traditional setting, students are given
            a certain amount of time to achieve a certain amount of progress.
            There are some problems with this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>What if a student wants to go faster or further?</strong>
              They can't because they need to wait on the rest of the class!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >What if a student needs more time on some concepts?</strong
              >
              Tough luck since the rest of the class can't wait on one student.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mastery-based education is a dream come true for students and
            educators because it returns the focus from the instructor and the
            institution to the student. In summary, mastery-based education
            provides students with an environment where they are able to take
            the right amount of time to learn any concept. Then, the student
            proves they have mastered the concept BEFORE moving on to the next.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>What if a student wants to go faster or further?</strong>
              No problem! Prove your mastery when you're ready and move on to
              the next concept. No need to hang out and do busy work while you
              wait on classmates to catch up. But keep a level head... tomorrow
              it might be you who needs to go slower on a tough concept!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >What if a student needs more time on some concepts?</strong
              >
              No problem! Take the extra time you need on this concept and
              really "get it". When you're ready, prove your mastery and move
              on. Don't worry about going slower sometimes. Every student learns
              in different ways and at a different pace. Tomorrow it could be
              you blazing past your classmates while they take some extra time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          CodeX Academy believes a mastery-based approach is the best way to
          learn the art of software development. Any other approach tends to
          exclude those who need more time and tends to hold back those who can
          move more quickly.

          <p>
            Yes, you can keep working and paying the bills. Our program is
            designed to be flexible enough for working professionals, but robust
            enough to challenge full-time students!

            The minimum weekly time commitment is 20 hours, which might amount

            The minimum weekly time commitment is 20 hours, which might amount
            to an extra 3-4 hours a day (including weekends). However, if you
            can put in more time, you will advance more quickly and COULD
            potentially move into more advanced topics/areas to give you EVEN
            MORE of an edge in the job market.

          <p>
            In a self-paced program, each student is a bit different, but we
            could assume most students' days could start after getting off of
            work, and then:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Logging in to the learning system</li>
            <li>Check notes for where you left off yesterday</li>
            <li>Spend some time with learning materials</li>
            <li>Ask a question in the chat community, exchange some ideas</li>
            <li>Attend a status meeting with your cohort/level</li>
            <li>Apply new skills to your capstone project</li>
            <li>
              Get stuck, ask for help, end up in a pairing session with another
              student
            </li>
            <li>Attend a mentoring session or group class</li>

            Your day could look a bit different, depending on your needs and
            pace.

            CodeX Academy constantly searches the world for passionate, skilled
            and experienced Full-Stack Developers to serve as mentors,
            instructors and presenters. Each faculty member is recruited using a
            rigorous vetting process that verifies not only their skills but
            also their communication of thoughts and cultural fit with our
            school and students.
          </p>
          <p>
            All faculty members are part-time with CodeX so that they can
            continously refine their skills in their full-time development
            positions by day. Some faculty members hold university degrees.
            Other faculty members are self-taught engineers with years of wisdom
            and experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Absolutely NONE of our faculty are professional teachers. Why is
            that important? Because of the ever-changing nature of the software
            development industry, we feel it is of primary importance that our
            faculty members are up-to-date and skilled with current engineering
            trends. Otherwise, our students' skills would be obsolete before
            even getting their first job.

        <QAndA id="faq-who-leads" question='Is this bootcamp "Instructor-Led?"'>
          <p>
            Yes, it is. Like any course, we have a curriculum that serves as a
            roadmap to guide you as you are learning. You will have multiple
            touchpoints throughout the week to help keep you moving and on
            track. You will meet with a mentor at least once, a time you will grow
            to cherish. During mentoring sessions, you will strategize on next
            steps through the curriculum, troubleshoot tough problems, and do
            some pair programming. Your instructors and mentors will lead you
            through the process of learning to code.

        <QAndA
          id="faq-terms"
          question="What is the difference between Front-End, Back-End and Full-Stack?"
        >
          <p>
            A <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> is someone who works with the
            user interface to make sure buttons do the right things, pages load
            correctly, user input is saved to the right place, etc. Basically,
            everything you touch in a website or a mobile app was built by a
            front-end developer (with a designer's help, of course).
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Back-End Developer</strong> is someone who works more with
            servers and databases. Back-end devs make sure entire systems tie
            together properly, data is secure, data is available to the
            front-end, etc. You'll never see anything a back-end developer does
            because their work is all behind the scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> has skill and experience in
            both the front-end and the back-end. Full-Stack devs often know
            multiple programming languages and can handle any situation no
            matter the layer. Full-stack devs are very valuable because of their
            versatility.

          <p>
            If this is on your mind, then you must really understand how a
            self-paced curriculum works! In a mastery-based program like we have
            in CodeX Academy, learning is naturally self-paced. While we
            wholeheartedly believe this is the BEST way to learn to code,
            self-paced programs also come with some natural pitfall or risks.
            One such risk is the possibility of getting behind and running out
            of time. This is a reality we help students work through on a daily
            basis. Here are a few of our typical strategies:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Weekly Trajectory Evaluations: </b> They say, "An ounce of
            prevention is worth a pound of cure." We agree! Rather than waiting
            until it's too late to correct your course, we prefer a more
            granular approach. Each week, we look at the data for each student
            and calculate their new trajectory based on past progress. If any
            student is falling behind, we meet with them to strategize and plan
            a way back.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Time Extensions: </b> Sometimes it's better to plan on some extra
            time in our program rather than trying to cram in too much in a
            short amount of time... it all depends on what your brain needs! We
            have various options to extend your time in the program so that you
            can take the time you truly need to gain real mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Target Resets: </b> There may be scenarios where it is
            appropriate to adjust your target level so that you can finish on
            time with less pressure. Unlike universities or traditional programs
            where "graduation" is the only meaningful achievement, CodeX Academy
            provides numerous independently-valuable milestones called
            "certifications". We have nine such certifications, each
            representing valuable and marketable sets of skills. Perhaps you
            originally set a goal of achieving level 6 (Full-Stack Developer),
            but find yourself running out of time. At that point in time, it
            might be improbable that you could achieve level 6, but more
            possible to achieve level 4 or 5 (still very respectable levels!).
            Resetting your target level can help relieve some pressure and
            ensure a stronger finish!

          <p>
            Pricing Example. $4500 for a 3mo plan (fulltime). This is our
            Front-End developer path We also offer part time which is 20hrs a
            week. This will be the same program content, just at half pace and
            take 6mo.

          id="faq-fed-vs-fsd"
          question="What is difference between Front-End Developer and Full-Stack Developer?"
        >
          <p>
            Front-End path enables you to build landing pages and simple
            websites, the Back-End enables you to handle complex back-end
            interfaces for eg databases, therefore Full Stack Developers can do
            Front End and Back End tasks.

            If you choose part-time we expect 20hrs per week. This is good for
            people that have full time jobs or other commitments. Full time is
            recommended for students that can commit 40hrs a week to this
            bootcamp.
