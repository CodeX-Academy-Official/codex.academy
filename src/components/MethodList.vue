      description="CodeX Academy believes mentorship is the key to achieving true mastery in programming. As you learn to code, you will get stuck several times (maybe a pesky semi-colon missing). As a CodeX Academy Learner, you have access to a personal mentor who can answer you via chat or even jump on a video call to work it out. Live 1-on-1 mentorship accelerates learning and makes it stick!"
