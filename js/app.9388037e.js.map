CodeX Academy currently offers learning\n          pathways for popular web-based technologies including ReactJS, NodeJS\n          and both PostgreSQL and Mongo databases. Along the way, you will also\n          be exposed to practices and principles that will make you a more\n          effective player on an Agile development team.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">\n          If you'd like to see our tech stack in more detail or learn more about\n          the technologies we like, click any logo below:\n        </p>\n        <Technologies />\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq3\" question=\"Can I get financing/financial aid?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy partners with Climb Credit to offer special financing\n          for any learning plan for a minimum of 3 months.

Some learners may face some hardship that impacts their\n          ability to stay committed to independent study and meeting with\n          mentors. We get it! If you need to pause your enrollment at any time,\n          just send an email to\n          <a href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\">Admissions</a> any time and\n          request it. We will make sure to pause your monthly payments and you\n          can resume at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Learners using financial aid may still be responsible for making\n          monthly payments, but it may be possible to \"make-up\" any lost time\n          when you resume your enrollment later on. To check eligibility or if\n          you have any questions, please email.\n          <a href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\">Admissions</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq5\" question=\"When do I graduate?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy does things a bit differently. We have ten \"levels\",\n          each representing a usable skill set. Everyone starts at level 1, but\n          not everyone \"graduates\" at the same level. For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites\n          and simple user interactions, you might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all\n          the systems involved in web applications. Those should target at least\n          level 6. After level 6 comes more levels that guide you through other\n          valuable skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So, as you can see, you may \"graduate\" at any level you wish,\n          depending on your personal goals.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- /.container -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Technologies\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!../../node_modules/vue-svg-inline-loader/dist/index.min.js!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!../../node_modules/vue-svg-inline-loader/dist/index.min.js!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=0e64427a&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"0e64427a\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

That information includes\n      the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type\n      and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at,\n      while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n      information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible\n      for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service\n      provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of\n      connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n      to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By\n      identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design\n      the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and\n      ease of use.

This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers.
