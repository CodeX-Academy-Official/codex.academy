For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites\n          and simple user interactions, you might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all\n          the systems involved in web applications.

That information includes\n      the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type\n      and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at,\n      while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n      information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible\n      for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service\n      provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of\n      connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n      to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By\n      identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design\n      the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and\n      ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the\n      aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the\n      Website.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Web Cookies A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a\n      unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that\n      the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a\n      query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of\n      services you have used, to record registration information regarding your\n      login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you\n      logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company\n      also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each\n      Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to\n      help Company understand how the Website is being used.

COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO\n      HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO\n      REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\n      THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE\n      AID OF WEB COOKIES.

Using a tool\n      created by the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several\n      third-party ad servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously.

You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered\n      ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting\n      to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept\n      or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Analytics We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use\n      first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party\n      cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and\n      serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including Google\n      Analytics for Display Advertising.

We may combine Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also may share\n      aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers\n      and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.\n      For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the\n      Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This\n      information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and\n      may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and\n      other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mobile Device Additional Terms • Mobile Device.

Once connected, other users may\n      also be able to see information about your social network, such as the\n      size of your network and your friends, including common friends. By\n      connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social\n      networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of\n      information about you to us. We will not send any of your account\n      information to the connected social networking site without first\n      disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data\n      will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the\n      websites of these social networks and are not within our control.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n      Website Registration As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information\n      is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.\n      Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and\n      about Website users.
