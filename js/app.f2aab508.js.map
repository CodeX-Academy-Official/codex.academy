Learning to code\n          might be one of the hardest things you try to do in your life. The\n          learning process can be confusing, frustrating and discouraging.\n          Depending on your experience with computers and technology, some\n          concepts may take longer than expected to master. There may be times\n          when you feel like you have been stuck \"chasing your tail\" for hours.\n          We don't want to paint a bleak picture for you, but seriously,\n          learning to code is hard! Just like you should do when you plan a\n          caving trip, you should take a buddy (or go with a group). CodeX\n          Academy has built a community of learners and mentors who are\n          interested in walking alongside you while you learn. You may still get\n          stuck at times, but at least you will have the power of a community\n          around you to get you unstuck and moving again.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n

CodeX Academy currently offers learning\n          pathways for popular web-based technologies including ReactJS, NodeJS\n          and both PostgreSQL and Mongo databases. Along the way, you will also\n          be exposed to practices and principles that will make you a more\n          effective player on an Agile development team.\n        </p>\n        <p\n          class=\"mb-4\"\n        >If you'd like to see our tech stack in more detail or learn more about the technologies we like, click any logo below:</p>\n        <Technologies />\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq3\" question=\"Can I get financing/financial aid?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy partners with Climb Credit to offer special financing for any learning plan for a minimum of 3 months. \n          For more information, see\n          <a\n            href=\"https://climbcredit.com/students\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >Climb Credit</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq4\" question=\"Can I pause my enrollment?\">\n        <p>\n          Life happens! Some learners may face some hardship that impacts their ability to stay committed to independent study \n          and meeting with mentors. We get it! If you need to pause your enrollment at any time, just send an email to\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a> any time and request it. We will make sure to pause your monthly payments and you can resume at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Learners using financial aid may still be responsible for making monthly payments, but it may be possible to \"make-up\" \n          any lost time when you resume your enrollment later on. To check eligibility or if you have any questions, please email.\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq5\" question=\"When do I graduate?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy does things a bit differently. We have ten \"levels\", each representing a usable skill set.\n          Everyone starts at level 1, but not everyone \"graduates\" at the same level. For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites and simple user interactions, you\n          might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all the\n          systems involved in web applications. Those should target at least level 6. After level 6 comes more levels\n          that guide you through other valuable skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>So, as you can see, you may \"graduate\" at any level you wish, depending on your personal goals.</p>\n      </QAndA>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- /.container -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Technologies\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=6b718409&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"6b718409\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
