It's amazing how much high quality teaching materials exist\n              on the topic of \"coding\" alone... and tons of those are 100% free\n              of charge! CodeX Academy believes the world needs more coders, not\n              more coding classes. To that end, throughout the CodeX Academy\n              Learning Pathways you'll find references to a plethora of curated\n              community-driven learning materials. When combined with our\n              carefully designed Learning Pathways, you're set up for success!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row pb-7\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/pathway.png\"\n              alt=\"Badgr Pathways - Level 1\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Learning Pathways</h3>\n            <p>\n              If there's SO much community-driven (and even free) learning\n              material on the internet for coding, why aren't more people\n              learning? Part of it probably because learning to code is hard!\n              It's not for the faint of heart. It takes discipline, focus,\n              determination and resilience. But how do you know where to start?\n              What happens when you learn a certain technology? What's next? How\n              do you know when to stop learning about a certain thing (so that\n              you don't lose the information from lack of use)? These are\n              challenges CodeX Academy solves by providing learners with a\n              prescriptive, step-by-step pathway. Each step builds upon the\n              last. Learners are encouraged to learn \"just enough\" before moving\n              on. Taking this \"Lean\" approach to learning is the best way to\n              learn to code and MAKE IT STICK!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row mb-6\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/badge.png\"\n              alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Badges</h3>\n            <p>\n              The amount of information your brain has to absorb in order to\n              learn to code is immense. How in the world could all that\n              information be organized so that someone can learn efficiently and\n              effectively? Great question! CodeX Academy does it with badges! As\n              you work through our Learning Pathways, you will focus on\n              \"bite-sized\" slices of each technology and concept, working\n              towards mastery of a short list of skills. Once you have mastered\n              that badge, you continue on the next. Each badge not only contains\n              a list of skills/competencies, but also some suggested ways you\n              might learn those skills. Completing a badge feels great! Small\n              victories add up to big time success later on!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/slack.png\"\n              alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Community Support</h3>\n            <p>\n              There are three things no one should ever do alone: 1) spelunking,\n              2) hiking in the Grand Canyon and 2) learning to code.

Depending on your experience with computers and\n              technology, some concepts may take longer than expected to master.\n              There may be times when you feel like you have been stuck \"chasing\n              your tail\" for hours.

If you need to pause your enrollment at any time,\n          just send an email to\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a> any time and\n          request it. We will make sure to pause your monthly payments and you\n          can resume at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Learners using financial aid may still be responsible for making\n          monthly payments, but it may be possible to \"make-up\" any lost time\n          when you resume your enrollment later on. To check eligibility or if\n          you have any questions, please email.\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq5\" question=\"When do I graduate?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy does things a bit differently. We have ten \"levels\",\n          each representing a usable skill set. Everyone starts at level 1, but\n          not everyone \"graduates\" at the same level. For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites\n          and simple user interactions, you might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all\n          the systems involved in web applications. Those should target at least\n          level 6. After level 6 comes more levels that guide you through other\n          valuable skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So, as you can see, you may \"graduate\" at any level you wish,\n          depending on your personal goals.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- /.container -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Technologies\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=18a056f4&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"18a056f4\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
