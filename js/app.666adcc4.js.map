To that end, throughout the CodeX Academy Learning Pathways\n          you'll find references to a plethora of curated community-driven\n          learning materials. When combined with our carefully designed Learning\n          Pathways, you're set up for success!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /.row -->\n\n    <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n    <!-- Project One -->\n    <div class=\"row pb-7\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n        <img\n          class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n          src=\"/img/screenshots/pathway.png\"\n          alt=\"Badgr Pathways - Level 1\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Learning Pathways</h3>\n        <p>\n          If there's SO much community-driven (and even free) learning material\n          on the internet for coding, why aren't more people learning? Part of\n          it probably because learning to code is hard! It's not for the faint\n          of heart. It takes discipline, focus, determination and resillience.\n          But how do you know where to start? What happens when you learn a\n          certain technology? What's next? How do you know when to stop learning\n          about a certain thing (so that you don't lose the information from\n          lack of use)? These are challenges CodeX Academy solves by providing\n          learners with a prescriptive, step-by-step pathway. Each step builds\n          upon the last. Learners are encouraged to learn \"just enough\" before\n          moving on. Taking this \"Lean\" approach to learning is the best way to\n          learn to code and MAKE IT STICK!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /.row -->\n\n    <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n    <!-- Project One -->\n    <div class=\"row mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n        <img\n          class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n          src=\"/img/screenshots/badge.png\"\n          alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Badges</h3>\n        <p>\n          The amount of information your brain has to absorb in order to learn\n          to code is immense.

As you work through our\n          Learning Pathways, you will focus on \"bite-sized\" slices of each\n          technology and concept, working towards mastery of a short list of\n          skills. Once you have mastered that badge, you continue on the next.\n          Each badge not only contains a list of skills/competencies, but also\n          some suggested ways you might learn those skills.

Learning to code\n          might be one of the hardest things you try to do in your life. The\n          learning process can be confusing, frustrating and discouraging.\n          Depending on your experience with computers and technology, some\n          concepts may take longer than expected to master.

Just like you should do when you plan a\n          caving trip, you should take a buddy (or go with a group).

Part-time\n          students are welcome too, but the timing might stretch out a bit.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"img/learner-flow.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq2\" question=\"What technologies will I learn at CodeX Academy?\">\n        <p>\n          A “Full-Stack Developer” is someone who can build world-changing apps\n          and websites from top to bottom, from what you can see to\n          all the unseen inner-workings. CodeX Academy currently offers learning\n          pathways for popular web-based technologies including ReactJS, NodeJS\n          and both PostgreSQL and Mongo databases. Along the way, you will also\n          be exposed to practices and principles that will make you a more\n          effective player on an Agile development team.\n        </p>\n        <p\n          class=\"mb-4\"\n        >If you'd like to see our tech stack in more detail or learn more about the technologies we like, click any logo below:</p>\n        <Technologies />\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq3\" question=\"Can I get financing/financial aid?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy partners with Climb Credit to offer special financing for any learning plan for a minimum of 3 months.

Some learners may face some hardship that impacts their ability to stay committed to independent study and meeting with mentors. We get it! If you need to pause your enrollment at any time, just send an email to\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a> any time and request it. We will make sure to pause your monthly payments and you can resume at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Learners using financial aid may still be responsible for making monthly payments, but it may be possible to \"make-up\" any lost time when you resume your enrollment later on. To check elegibility or if you have any questions, please email\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq5\" question=\"When do I graduate?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy does things a bit differently. We have ten \"levels\", each representing a usable skill set.\n          Everyone starts at level 1, but not everyone \"graduates\" at the same level. For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites and simple user interactions, you\n          might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all the\n          systems involved in web applications. Those should target at least level 6. After level 6 comes more levels\n          that guide you through other valuable skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>So, as you can see, you may \"graduate\" at any level you wish, depending on your personal goals.</p>\n      </QAndA>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- /.container -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Technologies\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=6eff7d8a&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"6eff7d8a\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
