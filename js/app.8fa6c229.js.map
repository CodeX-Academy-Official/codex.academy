The whole world is trying to teach you to code!\n          It's amazing how much high quality teaching materials exist on the\n          topic of \"coding\" alone... and tons of those are 100% free of charge!\n          CodeX Academy believes the world needs more coders, not more coding\n          classes. To that end, throughout the CodeX Academy Learning Pathways\n          you'll find references to a plethora of curated community-driven\n          learning materials. When combined with our carefully designed Learning\n          Pathways, you're set up for success!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /.row -->\n\n    <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n    <!-- Project One -->\n    <div class=\"row pb-7\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n        <img\n          class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n          src=\"/img/screenshots/pathway.png\"\n          alt=\"Badgr Pathways - Level 1\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Learning Pathways</h3>\n        <p>\n          If there's SO much community-driven (and even free) learning material\n          on the internet for coding, why aren't more people learning? Part of\n          it probably because learning to code is hard! It's not for the faint\n          of heart. It takes discipline, focus, determination and resillience.\n          But how do you know where to start? What happens when you learn a\n          certain technology? What's next? How do you know when to stop learning\n          about a certain thing (so that you don't lose the information from\n          lack of use)? These are challenges CodeX Academy solves by providing\n          learners with a prescriptive, step-by-step pathway. Each step builds\n          upon the last. Learners are encouraged to learn \"just enough\" before\n          moving on. Taking this \"Lean\" approach to learning is the best way to\n          learn to code and MAKE IT STICK!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /.row -->\n\n    <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n    <!-- Project One -->\n    <div class=\"row mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n        <img\n          class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n          src=\"/img/screenshots/badge.png\"\n          alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Badges</h3>\n        <p>\n          The amount of information your brain has to absorb in order to learn\n          to code is immense. How in the world could all that information be\n          organized so that someone can learn efficiently and effectively? Great\n          question! CodeX Academy does it with badges! As you work through our\n          Learning Pathways, you will focus on \"bite-sized\" slices of each\n          technology and concept, working towards mastery of a short list of\n          skills. Once you have mastered that badge, you continue on the next.\n          Each badge not only contains a list of skills/competencies, but also\n          some suggested ways you might learn those skills. Completing a badge\n          feels great! Small victories add up to big time success later on!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- /.row -->\n\n    <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n    <!-- Project One -->\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n        <img\n          class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n          src=\"/img/screenshots/slack.png\"\n          alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Community Support</h3>\n        <p>\n          There are three things no one should ever do alone: 1) spelunking, 2)\n          hiking in the Grand Canyon and 2) learning to code. Learning to code\n          might be one of the hardest things you try to do in your life. The\n          learning process can be confusing, frustrating and discouraging.\n          Depending on your experience with computers and technology, some\n          concepts may take longer than expected to master. There may be times\n          when you feel like you have been stuck \"chasing your tail\" for hours.\n          We don't want to paint a bleak picture for you, but seriously,\n          learning to code is hard! Just like you should do when you plan a\n          caving trip, you should take a buddy (or go with a group). CodeX\n          Academy has built a community of learners and mentors who are\n          interested in walking alongside you while you learn. You may still get\n          stuck at times, but at least you will have the power of a community\n          around you to get you unstuck and moving again.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n

That information includes\n      the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type\n      and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at,\n      while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n      information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible\n      for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service\n      provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of\n      connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n      to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By\n      identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design\n      the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and\n      ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the\n      aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the\n      Website.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Web Cookies A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a\n      unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that\n      the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a\n      query to the website.

Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers.

So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website.
