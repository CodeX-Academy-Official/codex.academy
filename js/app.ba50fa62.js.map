To that end, throughout the CodeX Academy Learning Pathways\n              you'll find references to a plethora of curated community-driven\n              learning materials.

Part of\n              it probably because learning to code is hard! It's not for the faint\n              of heart. It takes discipline, focus, determination and resillience.\n              But how do you know where to start? What happens when you learn a\n              certain technology? What's next? How do you know when to stop learning\n              about a certain thing (so that you don't lose the information from\n              lack of use)? These are challenges CodeX Academy solves by providing\n              learners with a prescriptive, step-by-step pathway. Each step builds\n              upon the last. Learners are encouraged to learn \"just enough\" before\n              moving on. Taking this \"Lean\" approach to learning is the best way to\n              learn to code and MAKE IT STICK!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row mb-6\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/badge.png\"\n              alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Badges</h3>\n            <p>\n              The amount of information your brain has to absorb in order to learn\n              to code is immense. How in the world could all that information be\n              organized so that someone can learn efficiently and effectively? Great\n              question! CodeX Academy does it with badges! As you work through our\n              Learning Pathways, you will focus on \"bite-sized\" slices of each\n              technology and concept, working towards mastery of a short list of\n              skills. Once you have mastered that badge, you continue on the next.\n              Each badge not only contains a list of skills/competencies, but also\n              some suggested ways you might learn those skills. Completing a badge\n              feels great!

Along the way, you will also\n          be exposed to practices and principles that will make you a more\n          effective player on an Agile development team.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">\n          If you'd like to see our tech stack in more detail or learn more about\n          the technologies we like, click any logo below:\n        </p>\n        <Technologies />\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq3\" question=\"Can I get financing/financial aid?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy partners with Climb Credit to offer special financing\n          for any learning plan for a minimum of 3 months. For more information,\n          see\n          <a\n            href=\"https://climbcredit.com/students\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >Climb Credit</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq4\" question=\"Can I pause my enrollment?\">\n        <p>\n          Life happens! Some learners may face some hardship that impacts their\n          ability to stay committed to independent study and meeting with\n          mentors. We get it! If you need to pause your enrollment at any time,\n          just send an email to\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a> any time and\n          request it. We will make sure to pause your monthly payments and you\n          can resume at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Learners using financial aid may still be responsible for making\n          monthly payments, but it may be possible to \"make-up\" any lost time\n          when you resume your enrollment later on. To check eligibility or if\n          you have any questions, please email.\n          <a\n            href=\"mailto:admissions@codex.academy\"\n          >Admissions</a>.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n\n      <QAndA id=\"faq5\" question=\"When do I graduate?\">\n        <p>\n          CodeX Academy does things a bit differently. We have ten \"levels\",\n          each representing a usable skill set. Everyone starts at level 1, but\n          not everyone \"graduates\" at the same level. For example, if you are\n          content with the front-end skills needed to create marketing websites\n          and simple user interactions, you might go for level 3 and stop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Others want to work as a full-stack developer and take charge of all\n          the systems involved in web applications. Those should target at least\n          level 6. After level 6 comes more levels that guide you through other\n          valuable skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So, as you can see, you may \"graduate\" at any level you wish,\n          depending on your personal goals.\n        </p>\n      </QAndA>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- /.container -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Technologies\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=18a056f4&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"18a056f4\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

We may also share it with third parties and\n      our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the\n      Website and on websites of third parties. We may combine Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also may share\n      aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers\n      and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.\n      For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the\n      Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This\n      information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and\n      may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and\n      other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mobile Device Additional Terms • Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device\n      to access the Website or download any of our applications, we may collect\n      device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and\n      manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address. •\n      Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we\n      do not access or track any location-based information from your mobile\n      device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or\n      our services, except that it may be possible for Company to determine from\n      an IP address the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in\n      which case we may gather and use such general location data. • Push\n      Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive\n      them, letting you know when someone has sent you a message or for other\n      service-related matters. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types\n      of communications, you may turn them off in your device’s settings. •\n      Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better\n      understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This\n      software may record information, such as how often you use the\n      application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated\n      usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We\n      do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any\n      Personally-Identifying Information you submit within the mobile\n      application.\n    </p>\n    <h5>SOCIAL MEDIA</h5>\n    <p>\n      We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Website to\n      your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging\n      in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Website.\n      When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the\n      Personally-Identifying Information you have made publicly available on the\n      social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo,\n      username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any\n      other information you have made public. Once connected, other users may\n      also be able to see information about your social network, such as the\n      size of your network and your friends, including common friends. By\n      connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social\n      networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of\n      information about you to us. We will not send any of your account\n      information to the connected social networking site without first\n      disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data\n      will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the\n      websites of these social networks and are not within our control.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n      Website Registration As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information\n      is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.\n      Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and\n      about Website users.

BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE\n      AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN\n      THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING\n      INFORMATION” SECTION.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Online Postings Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from\n      users may be disclosed as a matter of course as a result of your use of\n      the Website.

Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal\n      information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be\n      publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example,\n      if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We\n      cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the\n      information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise\n      discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

Other than to the extent\n      ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all\n      transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this\n      Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that\n      new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out\n      of it.
