The whole world is trying to teach you to\n              code! It's amazing how much high quality teaching materials exist\n              on the topic of \"coding\" alone... and tons of those are 100% free\n              of charge! CodeX Academy believes the world needs more coders, not\n              more coding classes. To that end, throughout the CodeX Academy\n              Learning Pathways you'll find references to a plethora of curated\n              community-driven learning materials. When combined with our\n              carefully designed Learning Pathways, you're set up for success!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row pb-7\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/pathway.png\"\n              alt=\"Badgr Pathways - Level 1\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Learning Pathways</h3>\n            <p>\n              If there's SO much community-driven (and even free) learning\n              material on the internet for coding, why aren't more people\n              learning? Part of it probably because learning to code is hard!\n              It's not for the faint of heart. It takes discipline, focus,\n              determination and resilience. But how do you know where to start?\n              What happens when you learn a certain technology? What's next? How\n              do you know when to stop learning about a certain thing (so that\n              you don't lose the information from lack of use)? These are\n              challenges CodeX Academy solves by providing learners with a\n              prescriptive, step-by-step pathway. Each step builds upon the\n              last. Learners are encouraged to learn \"just enough\" before moving\n              on. Taking this \"Lean\" approach to learning is the best way to\n              learn to code and MAKE IT STICK!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row mb-6\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/badge.png\"\n              alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Badges</h3>\n            <p>\n              The amount of information your brain has to absorb in order to\n              learn to code is immense. How in the world could all that\n              information be organized so that someone can learn efficiently and\n              effectively? Great question! CodeX Academy does it with badges! As\n              you work through our Learning Pathways, you will focus on\n              \"bite-sized\" slices of each technology and concept, working\n              towards mastery of a short list of skills. Once you have mastered\n              that badge, you continue on the next. Each badge not only contains\n              a list of skills/competencies, but also some suggested ways you\n              might learn those skills. Completing a badge feels great! Small\n              victories add up to big time success later on!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.row -->\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <!-- Project One -->\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col-md-5\">\n            <img\n              class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 mb-md-0 screenshot\"\n              src=\"/img/screenshots/slack.png\"\n              alt=\"Slack Screenshot\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n            <h3>Community Support</h3>\n            <p>\n              There are three things no one should ever do alone: 1) spelunking,\n              2) hiking in the Grand Canyon and 2) learning to code. Learning to\n              code might be one of the hardest things you try to do in your\n              life. The learning process can be confusing, frustrating and\n              discouraging. Depending on your experience with computers and\n              technology, some concepts may take longer than expected to master.\n              There may be times when you feel like you have been stuck \"chasing\n              your tail\" for hours. We don't want to paint a bleak picture for\n              you, but seriously, learning to code is hard! Just like you should\n              do when you plan a caving trip, you should take a buddy (or go\n              with a group). CodeX Academy has built a community of learners and\n              mentors who are interested in walking alongside you while you\n              learn. You may still get stuck at times, but at least you will\n              have the power of a community around you to get you unstuck and\n              moving again.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <hr class=\"mb-5 mt-5\" />\n\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col text-center\">\n            <SelectPlanButton :plan=\"getCommunityPlan\" text=\"Start Application\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mb-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { mapGetters } from \"vuex\";\nimport SelectPlanButton from \"@/components/SelectPlanButton\";\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: { SelectPlanButton, Hero },\n  computed: { ...mapGetters([\"getCommunityPlan\"]) }\n};\n</script>\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\nimg.screenshot {\n  border: grey solid 1px;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Community.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
