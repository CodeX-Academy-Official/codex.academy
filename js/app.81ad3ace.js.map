By\n      connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social\n      networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of\n      information about you to us. We will not send any of your account\n      information to the connected social networking site without first\n      disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data\n      will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the\n      websites of these social networks and are not within our control.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n      Website Registration As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information\n      is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.\n      Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and\n      about Website users.

In addition, such postings\n      may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject\n      of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal\n      information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be\n      publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example,\n      if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We\n      cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the\n      information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise\n      discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

Other than to the extent\n      ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all\n      transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this\n      Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that\n      new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out\n      of it.
