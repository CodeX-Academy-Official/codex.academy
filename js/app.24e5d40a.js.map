Back-end devs make sure entire systems tie\n            together properly, data is secure, data is available to the\n            front-end, etc. You'll never see anything a back-end developer does\n            because their work is all behind the scenes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> has skill and experience in\n            both the front-end and the back-end. Full-Stack devs often know\n            multiple programming languages and can handle any situation no\n            matter the layer. Full-stack devs are very valuable because of their\n            versatility.\n          </p>\n        </QAndA>\n\n        <QAndA\n          id=\"faq-finish-on-time\"\n          question=\"What if I don't complete the curriculum before my end date?\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            If this is on your mind, then you must really understand how a\n            self-paced curriculum works! In a mastery-based program like we have\n            in CodeX Academy, learning is naturally self-paced. While we\n            wholeheartedly believe this is the BEST way to learn to code,\n            self-paced programs also come with some natural pitfall or risks.\n            One such risk is the possibility of getting behind and running out\n            of time. This is a reality we help students work through on a daily\n            basis. Here are a few of our typical strategies:\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Weekly Trajectory Evaluations: </b> They say, \"An ounce of\n            prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" We agree! Rather than waiting\n            until it's too late to correct your course, we prefer a more\n            granular approach. Each week, we look at the data for each student\n            and calculate their new trajectory based on past progress. If any\n            student is falling behind, we meet with them to strategize and plan\n            a way back.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Time Extensions: </b> Sometimes it's better to plan on some extra\n            time in our program rather than trying to cram in too much in a\n            short amount of time... it all depends on what your brain needs! We\n            have various options to extend your time in the program so that you\n            can take the time you truly need to gain real mastery.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Target Resets: </b> There may be scenarios where it is\n            appropriate to adjust your target level so that you can finish on\n            time with less pressure. Unlike universities or traditional programs\n            where \"graduation\" is the only meaningful achievement, CodeX Academy\n            provides numerous independently-valuable milestones called\n            \"certifications\". We have nine such certifications, each\n            representing valuable and marketable sets of skills. Perhaps you\n            originally set a goal of achieving level 6 (Full-Stack Developer),\n            but find yourself running out of time. At that point in time, it\n            might be improbable that you could achieve level 6, but more\n            possible to achieve level 4 or 5 (still very respectable levels!).\n            Resetting your target level can help relieve some pressure and\n            ensure a stronger finish!\n          </p>\n        </QAndA>\n        <QAndA\n          id=\"faq-cost\"\n          question=\"Is there any financial aid for international students?\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            Currently we only support Credit Card payments for International\n            students.\n          </p>\n        </QAndA>\n        <QAndA\n          id=\"faq-schedule-pricing\"\n          question=\"What would the schedule and pricing look like?\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            Pricing Example. $4500 for a 3mo plan (fulltime).

That information includes\n      the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type\n      and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at,\n      while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n      information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible\n      for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service\n      provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of\n      connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n      to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By\n      identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design\n      the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and\n      ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the\n      aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the\n      Website.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Web Cookies A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a\n      unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that\n      the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a\n      query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of\n      services you have used, to record registration information regarding your\n      login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you\n      logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company\n      also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each\n      Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to\n      help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website,\n      Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered\n      using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better\n      understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO\n      HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO\n      REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\n      THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE\n      AID OF WEB COOKIES.

You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered\n      ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting\n      to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept\n      or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Analytics We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use\n      first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party\n      cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and\n      serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including Google\n      Analytics for Display Advertising.

We may combine Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally\n      Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also may share\n      aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers\n      and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.\n      For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the\n      Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This\n      information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and\n      may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and\n      other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mobile Device Additional Terms • Mobile Device.

By\n      connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social\n      networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of\n      information about you to us. We will not send any of your account\n      information to the connected social networking site without first\n      disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data\n      will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the\n      websites of these social networks and are not within our control.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n      Website Registration As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information\n      is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.\n      Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and\n      about Website users.
